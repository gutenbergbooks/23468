<p>In consequence of the extreme prevalence of Scrofulous, Scorbutic, and
Cancerous Diseases, and the ignorance which exists on the part of the
public, as to their causes, symptoms, and nature, I have been induced
to reprint my observations on those subjects, and to send forth an
Eighth Edition for the information of the afflicted.</p>

<p>To these remarks, I have appended a relation of several cases, which
have been cured by a peculiar mode of treatment which I have been in
the habit of employing for twenty-six years; during which long period I
have seen and treated an immense number of cases of the above
description.</p>

<p>These cases I have rendered very concise, preferring the main points
in each to a verbose and tiresome description of the minuti&aelig;; and
although the number might have been extended to many hundreds, I trust
a sufficiency have been detailed to establish the success of my
practice, and to show the afflicted the nature and modes of attack of
the diseases above mentioned.</p>

<p>I have confined myself to a simple relation of the facts of each case,
and on those facts such case must stand or fall. I have not resorted
to those <i>artificial props</i> which some men are in the habit of
employing because the cases themselves are too lame to stand alone; I
allude to the practice of soliciting the attestations of the patients,
and decoying the simple, the ignorant, well-intentioned, but deceived
neighbours, to add their signatures to cases of which they know
nothing, and of which the details are a series of bombast, falsehood,
ignorance, and humbug. There are many of the cases which I have
related to which I could have obtained the signatures of clergymen,
Members of Parliament, magistrates, and other persons high in rank and
station in life, without saying a word about overseers, churchwardens,
and parishioners, the signatures of whom might be obtained at all
times; but, established as my practice is, I would scorn to importune
those gentlemen, and impertinently to place their names before the
public in a position which every sensible man must declare to be that
of extreme negligence, ignorance, or unbecoming officiousness.</p>

<p>It may be readily supposed, that from the long career of success which
I have had in the treatment of scrofulous diseases, some impudent
individuals should have attempted to imitate my mode of proceeding,
and to foist themselves and their spurious <i>remedies</i> upon the public;
of this I should have cared nothing had they not done it at my
expense; because these inventions will find their proper level in the
estimation of the public, notwithstanding their props and delusions.
But these men are absolutely so ignorant, that they are compelled to
copy my cases and observations <i>verbatim</i>; and I have little doubt
that this edition will have issued from the press but a very few
months, before one or other of them will be purloining such parts of
it as their hired scribes may consider to answer their purpose. Not
that these imposters <i>understand</i> the observations which I have made
on scrofula or cancer, their heads are too empty&mdash;their ignorance too
profound&mdash;and their pretensions consequently too barefaced. Relying
upon the credulity of the public, they make no scruple in being guilty
of glaring plagiarism; they thus strut about in borrowed plumes, and
their presumption keeps pace with their want of information.</p>

<p>As a proof of the grossest ignorance, I have seen it asserted that
sixty cases of <i>confirmed</i> (or constitutional) cancer in the mouth or
throat, have been treated with complete success; while, in reality,
the cases, <i>if they ever existed</i>, (of which I have considerable
doubt) were either of a scrofulous nature, or the remains of a certain
disease. I am confident the pretender <span class="smcap">never</span> saw
a <i>real case</i> of cancer of the mouth and throat; and the very
assertion that portions of bone have been exfoliated in these cases,
gives the lie direct to the whole, for it is a fact that cancer never
causes bone to <i>exfoliate</i>, and in this I am borne out by every
medical authority. It may cause the long bones to become fragile, so
that the patient may have a fractured limb from a very slight cause,
or it may convert bone into a dense carcinomatous structure; but
<i>exfoliation will never take place</i>. Then as to the occurrence of
<i>confirmed</i> cancer in the mouth and throat, I have no hesitation in
stating that it <i>rarely if ever occurs</i>, and that if it ever did, it
was a perfectly incurable disease; and I could cite a host of
authorities to prove my assertion. And who is to oppose these great
authorities? What man with experience so extensive&mdash;with
knowledge so profound&mdash;with sagacity so searching&mdash;with
learning so deep&mdash;shall declare that he himself has seen and
treated sixty cases of <i>true carcinomatous disease</i> of the mouth and
throat? Who is this Goliah of Surgery? Who is the judge in this matter
to whose opinion he commands us to bow? Reader! the fact is, that the
assertion is so glaringly false, that if only a particle of shame
enter into his composition, it must betray its existence.</p>

<p>This, however, is only one part of the fabricated statements which
have been delusively put forth to deceive and misguide the public; but
I presume it would be a waste of time to attempt to prove the
abominable practices of these empirics; not that it would be a
difficult matter to do so, for were I so disposed I could adduce such
a body of evidence as would demolish their empty pretensions with as
much ease as the sun dispels the morning vapours. But I think my
readers will agree with me that I have displayed enough of their
charlatanry to satisfy any man who lays claim to anything like common
sense.</p>

<p>Leaving, then, these literary delinquents to their <span class="smcap">
honest</span> <i>reflections</i>, I have merely to observe, that the
medicines and applications which I am in the habit of using, are
principally selected from indigenous plants; and I cannot but regret
that the medical botany of our own country should have been so much
neglected; and I am not singular in this opinion, as many eminent
medical men have expressed themselves to the same effect; and, indeed,
many of the plants which I use are now frequently resorted to by the
faculty. I claim <i>no specific</i> in the treatment of those diseases
which come under my cognizance; I merely state that my mode of
managing those cases has been extremely successful, and refer the
reader to the following cases as a proof of my assertion.</p>

<p>It will be seen that many of these cases have been of long standing.
This has been done for the purpose of showing that the medicines and
treatment generally exert a permanent effect on the constitution of
the patient, thus allaying the scruples of many persons, that although
they may be successful for a certain period, they may not prevent a
relapse. This may be perfectly true in some cases; all the patients in
these cases were perfectly well when this pamphlet went to press; yet
I will not positively assert that they shall always continue so. This
assurance would be foolish and indiscreet, because there is scarcely
one disease to which the human frame is subject, which may not, on
some peculiar exciting cause being applied, be again brought into
action, although the person may have been perfectly relieved from the
first attack. Instances of this description frequently occur in
secondary attacks of measles, small-pox, scarlet fever, &amp;c.; and
surely it may occur in a disease like scrofula, the nature and
treatment of which has "<i>perplexed the researches and baffled the
efforts of the most eminent writers and practitioners of Europe</i>." At
any rate, when we see cases of twenty years' standing, and upwards,
there is but little room for suspicion of a relapse.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to beg that the reader will attentively peruse
the observations on Scrofula and Cancer; as I consider it highly
important that every individual should be fully acquainted with the
symptoms of these, too often, intractable diseases, and that their
approaches should be crushed at the onset. As to the cases, the reader
is at full liberty to make every inquiry; and being based upon the
foundation of truth, I have no apprehension as to the result proving
perfectly satisfactory, whether such inquiry be directed by an honest
impulse, or by feelings of a more questionable description.</p>

<p><span class="small">Scrofula, at every time of life, is the most formidable enemy of the
human race, and, under various shapes, it occasions more deaths than
all other chronic diseases whatever.&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">M. Poilroux</span>.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>This disease is extremely prevalent in this country; so much so that
scarcely any family can claim an exemption from its attacks. It is
technically called <i>Struma</i>, or <i>Scrofula</i>, which are synonymous
terms; but in common language it is called the King's Evil. The latter
appellation is derived from the circumstance of Edward the Confessor,
touching persons afflicted with it; and it is said they were
miraculously cured thereby. This practice was continued down to the
reign of Charles the Second, who touched 92,000 persons afflicted with
the disease; and it appears that Queen Anne was the last Sovereign who
practised such a ridiculous and superstitious imposition. Having thus
disposed of the origin of the name of the disease, I may observe that
it is more particularly prevalent in those countries where there are
great vicissitudes of weather; hence it prevails in Scotland, and the
northern parts of Germany and France, as well as in Great Britain; in
fact, a cold atmosphere, in almost any country, powerfully predisposes
to, or excites an attack of scrofula. It is on this well-known
principle that we are enabled to explain the frequent occurrence of
the disease in this country during the changeable state of the Spring
and Autumn seasons; for it is perfectly true, that it frequently makes
its first appearance at one or other of those periods; or where it may
be already in existence it becomes excessively aggravated. This
disease cannot be propagated by contact or contagion; it exists in
individuals in whom there is a peculiarity of constitution which
predisposes them to its attacks; and this brings me to the
consideration of one of the most important causes of the disease,
namely, <i>an hereditary taint</i>. It is a well ascertained fact that 99
cases out of 100 arise from this cause, and the result of my practice
corroborates it. It is, however, very remarkable that it may appear in
one generation, pass over the second, and appear again in the third.
The other causes of this disease are bad and unwholesome diet,
insufficient clothing, neglect of exercise, and want of proper
cleanliness. I may also observe, that it frequently makes its first
appearance after an attack of measles, small-pox, rheumatic fever, or
other debilitating affections; and it is often excited into obvious
existence by blows, sprains, bruises, or other accidents.</p>

<p>This disease may attack any part of the human body; but in general
commences in the <i>glandular</i> structures, such as the glands in the
arm-pits, in the neck, &amp;c.; it often also attacks the joints, as the
knee, the elbow, the hip, the wrist, the ankle, and likewise the
fingers and toes. Too often it does not confine its ravages to the
external parts, but it attacks the vital parts; when it affects the
lungs it is called consumption, and I wish this to be particularly
understood, that <i>consumption is neither more nor less than scrofula
of the lungs</i>. When it attacks the glands of the mesentery, the belly
becomes large and hard, while the legs and arms waste; the patient is
voracious, yet his food fails in affording sufficient nourishment, and
he gradually loses his strength and dies. Then the liver, the heart,
the spleen, and even the brain itself, may become the seats of this
dreadful disease. Lastly, we may mention that the bones are very
commonly affected, and even destroyed, from the attacks and long
continuance of the disease. Hence it will be seen, that both internal
and external parts of the human body are equally liable to the ravages
of scrofula; and it is proper to remark, that it often commences
externally, and after an uncertain time, it leaves the surface and
attacks the internal parts, in which case it almost invariably
terminates fatally. Many times have I seen the disease commence in the
joints, or in the glandular parts, and go on for a considerable length
of time; it has then left these parts, and the unhappy patient has
been carried off by consumption, or scrofula of the lungs. In the same
manner have I often remarked, that after limbs have been amputated for
scrofula, the operation has evidently hastened the death of the
patient, by the disease immediately attacking the more important
parts. It is for this reason that I have a decided objection to all
operations for scrofula, because the experience which I have had in
scrofula for the last 26 years, has proved to me that such operations
are worse than useless; I consider them as positively dangerous,
inasmuch as they hasten an event which in all probability might have
been prevented.&mdash;Scrofula is not a <i>local</i> disease which may be
remedied by the knife or any other local remedy; but it is a
<i>constitutional</i> disease, which must be treated by constitutional
means.</p>

<p>Now scrofula is so insidious in its approach, and so distressing, and
often fatal, in its consequences, that the form of its commencement
ought to be known to all individuals who are liable to its attacks,
either from an hereditary tendency, or other causes. When it commences
in the glands about the neck, behind the ears, in the arm-pits, hams,
&amp;c., it appears as hard and indolent swellings, somewhat moveable
under the skin, the colour of which is little changed; these tumours
or swellings gradually increase in number and size till they form one
large hard tumour, which often continues for a long time without
breaking, and when it does break it only discharges a thin <i>sanies</i> or
watery humour from one or more small apertures. The disease even then
maintains its indolent character; the ulcerated parts become languid
and inactive, and the constitution begins to be affected; the patient
complains of weakness&mdash;there is a want of appetite; there are
frequently profuse night sweats, and feeling of languor and lassitude.</p>

<p>When from blows, bruises, sprains, or other causes, the joints of the
elbows, wrists, ankles, knees, fingers or toes, become affected, the
disease proceeds in the same slow manner, frequently destroying the
ligaments or tendons; the matter insinuating itself between the bones
till they become carious, and ultimately destroyed. What is commonly
termed <i>white swelling</i> is of this description; it may continue for a
great length of time, and yet the patient may recover, excepting a
stiffness or contraction of the affected joint. I may also remark that
in Scrofulous constitutions there is frequently a thickness of the
upper lip, or swelling of the lower part of the nose; the eyes are
also peculiarly liable to attacks of scrofula, in which case the light
is remarkably offensive to those organs. The skin and muscles are
loose and flabby; and the mental powers of children so affected are
often prematurely displayed.</p>

<p>Having thus described the nature and symptoms of scrofula, I shall now
proceed to make some observations on the treatment of that disease.</p>

<p>The cure of scrofula is generally so difficult that it has become an
<i>opprobrium</i> of surgery. There is not <i>one</i> specific remedy for it;
even the medicines and applications which I am in the habit of
employing, will not be equally efficacious in persons of different
constitutions, nor in the same person at all times; and as such, some
little alteration frequently becomes necessary to adapt the remedies
to the present state of the disease. It is from this difficulty of
cure that so many remedies have been proposed in scrofula; and yet the
same difficulty continues, plainly shewing that the greater part of
these <i>nostra</i> are mere deceptions, imposing upon the sufferer, both
in mind and pocket. Hence the proposers of these fictitious remedies
become more bold and impudent than ever; nothing is too barefaced for
them to publish; not even that they can extract carious bone without
any other aid than "<i>the power of their medicines</i>,"&mdash;than which
nothing can be more impudently false. These deceptions, however, find
their proper level, and they then rapidly sink into oblivion. The
botanical medicines and applications which I have had the honour to
bring before the public as remedies for scrofula have stood the test
of <i>twenty-six years</i>' experience; during which period many hundreds
of cures have been effected solely by their agency. They still
maintain their unrivalled efficacy; scrofula has yielded its
stubbornness and its malignity to their powers in a vast variety of
instances, and they may be fairly considered as established in the
opinion of the public. Yet, notwithstanding this success, I do not
publish them as specifics; I am not vain enough to challenge the
world, like a mountebank; I am aware that they do, in some
constitutions, sometimes fail of effecting a cure; yet the great
majority of instances in which they have succeeded after every other
means had been tried, fully entitle them to superior consideration;
more especially, as in those cases where they may have failed of
complete success, they have evidently been of essential service in
retarding the progress and alleviating the pain of the disease. I
would also remark that they exert a permanent effect on the
constitution; the patient is not cured to-day and his case published
to-morrow; but most of the cures which I have published have been of
from <i>two to twenty years</i>' standing.</p>

<p>I would now particularly direct the attention of patients to the
nature, causes, and symptoms of scrofula, as detailed above, the more
especially as I have patients daily coming to me who do not know what
disease they are really labouring under, and express their
astonishment on being told its real nature. By attending to the
symptoms they might then attack the disease before it becomes fully
developed, when it "often produces the most miserable objects of human
wretchedness;" and when it frequently becomes impossible to say, "Thus
far shalt thou go, and no further."</p>

<h3><b><a name="CANCER" id="CANCER"></a>CANCER,</b></h3>
<h3>ITS NATURE AND SYMPTOMS.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Cancer</span> is, unfortunately, one of those desperate diseases to which the
human frame is liable, and more to be dreaded than any other, inasmuch
as it is insidious in its approach, and destructive to the greatest
degree when it is perfectly developed. It is so intractable and
malignant in its nature that it is generally considered an incurable
disease; and not without reason, as notwithstanding the great increase
of knowledge amongst that valuable portion of the community, the
medical profession, yet it baffles all their efforts to subdue it, and
sets at defiance all the triumphs of science. This disease rarely
occurs in young subjects. An eminent surgeon states, that in the
course of nearly forty years' extensive practice, he has seen but two
instances of its occurring under 30 years of age; most usually it
commences at the age of between forty and fifty years. Like many other
diseases it is frequently hereditary, many members of the same family
having become the subjects of cancer. It most usually attacks the
female breast, the lips, particularly the lower one, the tongue, the
skin, and the glandular parts about the neck and arm-pits; the
stomach, the liver, the lungs, and the brain, may also become affected
with this terrible malady. Sometimes it commences without any
ostensible cause, and the attention of the patient is frequently
directed to the case by mere accident; at other times, blows, bruises,
or continued pressure upon a part, may often be traced as the exciting
cause. In either case, however, it is generally found in the state of
a hard lump or knot, varying in its size, it is loose and moveable,
without pain or discolouration of the skin. It may continue in this
state for many months, or even years; it then enlarges, the surface of
the tumour becomes more or less knotty or uneven; it becomes hot and
painful, and the pain is of a peculiar darting, piercing nature, or
what the faculty technically call <i>lancinating</i>; and the patient's
health, which had hitherto continued tolerably well, now begins to
suffer from the irritation of the disease. In process of time the part
ulcerates, a discharge of fetid ichorous matter issues from it;
sometimes it bleeds freely, and there is a burning pain in the part.
The ulcer becomes of considerable size, and assumes a frightful
aspect. The patient becomes dejected in his spirits, his countenance
is sallow and woe worn, his appetite fails, his days and nights are
full of sorrow and pain, the disease still progresses, till, finally,
death comes to the aid of the unhappy sufferer, and closes the scene
of anguish and misery.</p>

<p>Such is the progress of this appalling malady. It commences apparently
in a trifling way, it terminates in destruction of life.</p>

<p>I have said that the patients' spirits are usually dejected in this
disease, and I wish this to be particularly noticed, as it points out
how cautious a medical man ought to be in stating positively to the
sufferer the real nature of his complaint. The mind is so depressed by
the disease, that the simple communication of the fact to the patient
often produces such a shock to the feelings as he rarely recovers
from; indeed, it often accelerates the death of the patient, and such
being the case, I am quite certain that no man of experience,
judgment, or common sense, would ever commit himself so seriously.
Whenever it is done, it is usually committed by some daring
unprincipled empiric, who often finds it to his interest to pronounce
a case cancerous when in 99 cases out of 100 it is really not so. Now,
with respect to the cure of cancer, I can confidently assert, that
when the disease is really cancer, when it occurs as a constitutional
disease, (as it almost always does) and when it is perfectly
developed, no known remedy is in existence which has the power of
destroying it. It sets even the knife at defiance, for I have
repeatedly seen that when the disease has been scientifically
extirpated, it either returns to the same part, or to the
neighbourhood of the same part, and in such cases the disease has
generally proceeded in its second attack with extraordinary rapidity.
I am strengthened in this assertion by the observations of Professor
Monro&mdash;he says, "<i>Of nearly sixty cancers which I have been present at
the extirpation of, only four patients remained free of the disease
for two years. Three of these lucky people had occult cancers in the
breast, and the fourth had an ulcerated cancer of the lip. The disease
does not always return to the part where the former tumour was taken
away, but more frequently in the neighbourhood, and sometimes at a
considerable distance. Upon a relapse, the disease in those I saw was
more violent, and made a much quicker progress than it did in others
on whom no operation had been performed</i>."&mdash;I believe the whole
medical profession are of the same opinion; in fact, those gentlemen
are candid enough to acknowledge that cancer is a disease over which
their art has no control. This is much to be deplored, inasmuch as it
has enabled the most unprincipled characters to practise their
impositions upon the unhappy sufferers with the greatest impunity.
What but the most consummate impudence can allow a man to assert that
he has cured a genuine cancer, when that very man does not know the
nature of cancer, or point out what is, or what is not, a malignant
disease?</p>

<p>Having thus described the nature and symptoms of cancer; and having
adverted to the effect of medicine upon this disease, I shall make
some remarks on the treatment of the same. I have stated there is no
specific remedy known for this disease; and that those who pretend to
such specific are <span class="smcap">imposters</span> of the most dangerous description; such
men will boast of "<i>great discoveries</i>;" they will sound their own
trumpet and tell you that they are men of "<i>great skill</i>;" they will
flourish a "<i>challenge to the world</i>;" and, in fact resort to every
means to entrap the unhappy sufferer, which great impudence, unbounded
ignorance, and glaring falsehoods, will enable them to do. I may also
allude to the indiscretion of those who are induced, by repeated
solicitations from such imposters, to allow their names to be appended
to cases which are false in fact, and only calculated to promote the
sordid motives of such characters. The attestators are thus led to
countenance an infamous species of deception; and are equally
responsible to the community for any injury which such men may
inflict. Hence they ought to be extremely careful in allowing this use
to be made of their names, as I cannot believe it to be their wish to
countenance such practices intentionally. I have thus exposed the
fallacy of such a specific for cancer, and in these remarks I am sure
I shall be supported by the whole medical profession.</p>

<p>I may now observe, that with regard to the treatment which I have
adopted in cancers for the last 26 years, I am ready to confess, that
it has often proved ineffectual as to a cure. During that period I
have seen an immense number of cancerous cases, and I candidly avow
that they have frequently disappointed my wishes, and the hopes of the
patients; I, therefore, do not publish to the world a specific,
because in that case I know I should be stating that which is
notoriously untrue; I should be guilty of a great moral sin, blasting
the hopes of those who might entrust themselves to my care, and
hurrying them to their graves, full of anger, grief, and
disappointment. All I can say is, that my mode of treatment is simple,
and that if it do not produce a cure it will at least mitigate the
sufferings of the patient. Many have left me in consequence of not
getting well, they have resorted to other means, and at last returned
to me again, because my mode of treatment appeared to be most suitable
to the disease. When I have failed in a cure, I have succeeded in
alleviating the pain and misery attendant upon such a dreadful
disease, and frequently retarded its progress.</p>

<p>I have thought proper to be thus explicit on the nature and cure of
cancer, and instead of vainly boasting of my success, I have candidly
expressed my opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>These generally originate in the use of unwholesome food, want of
cleanliness, and want of exercise; and sometimes from an hereditary
predisposition. They are also frequently dependent on a disordered or
deranged state of the stomach, liver, and bowels, and are often
attended with great debility and depression of spirits. They generally
appear most evident in cold and moist seasons; and, I may add, that
since the introduction of vaccination, I think cutaneous cases have
increased in number. The scurvy, by neglect or improper treatment, may
advance to such an alarming degree, in some constitutions, as to
endanger the patient's life; and I have seen and treated other
cutaneous diseases which were very closely allied to leprosy&mdash;the
legs, arms, thighs, and, in fact, the whole body, being covered with
scales, and the necessary movements of the patient would cause the
diseased parts to crack, and discharge blood, or a thin, acrid, and
burning ichor; yet, under all these circumstances, I have been
particularly successful in the treatment of these cases; a great
variety of them having yielded to the mode which I have suggested to
the sufferers, after many other means had been tried in vain.</p>

<p>Mr. WILLIAM WELHAM, of Culford, Suffolk, about 47 years of age, was
afflicted for several years with a violent scorbutic eruption, which
covered the whole face, accompanied with redness and chronic
inflammation; white scales or thin scabs frequently formed, and after
they had dropped off others formed successively. He had had the advice
of several respectable practitioners, and had used the preparations of
two chemists, without producing any good effect. In this state he
applied to J. Kent, Stanton, under whose treatment Mr. Welham perfectly
recovered. It is now <span class="smcap">eleven years</span> since, and he has had no return of
the disease.</p>

<h5><a name="case2" id="case2"></a>2.</h5>

<p>In consequence of the benefit which Mr. Welham had received from the
treatment adopted by J. Kent, he placed his son Joseph under his care.
He was about 19 years of age, and had a scrofulous tumour in the left
arm-pit; it had been about twelve months standing before he
discovered the nature of the complaint; and time had thus been allowed
for the arm to become considerably affected. However, under the system
pursued by J. Kent a perfect cure took place; and Mr. Welham and his
son are still living at Culford in good health, and free from any
remains of the disease.</p>

<h5><a name="case3" id="case3"></a>3.</h5>

<p>Mr. JOSEPH ADAMS GODFREY, of the Ferry House, West Row, Mildenhall,
Suffolk, from an hereditary taint had been subject to scrofula about
the face and glands of the neck for a considerable time; and, from the
unabated progress of the disease, his health was materially affected.
All the usual means had been resorted to in order to check its
progress; but the disease still increased, and became more and more
formidable. He then applied to J. Kent; the progress of the complaint
was soon arrested; and a permanent cure was accomplished. This was 20
years ago, and Mr. G. has had no relapse. Mr. G. resides as above; and
from his own sufferings, and from observation of the disease in
others, he has acquired some little judgment in discriminating
scrofulous cases.</p>

<h5><a name="case4" id="case4"></a>4.</h5>

<p>JAMES BENNETT was placed under the care of J. Kent, by the
churchwardens and overseers of Buxhall, Suffolk. He was afflicted with
scrofulous disease of the left side of the lower jaw, neck, and face.
The jaw was rendered immoveable, so that he could not take any solid
food; and the liquid nourishment he was compelled to suck through an
opening left from the extraction of a tooth. He had become remarkably
weak and low, and his constitution was daily giving way under the
severity of the attack. However, by attending to the rules
recommended by J. Kent, the jaw was soon set at liberty, and he
perfectly recovered. This was <i>twelve</i> years ago, and he is still
living at Buxhall in the enjoyment of good health.</p>

<p>Upwards of two years since the friends of a young Lady, about 13 years
of age, became exceedingly alarmed in consequence of her left breast
having become very much enlarged, with an ulcer of considerable size
situated in the centre. She suffered much from darting, piercing pains
in the part affected, and which extended into the arm-pit; and from
its continuance and gradually getting worse, her friends were afraid
it was of a cancerous nature. They then applied to J. Kent, who
dispelled their fears by candidly telling them it was not cancer,
although the symptoms were sufficiently alarming. She strictly
attended to the system prescribed by J. Kent, and in less than three
months was perfectly well, and is still enjoying good health, and free
from any vestige of the complaint&mdash;Any person wishing for further
information may have the name and address of the patient on

<p>ELIZABETH TAYLOR, of Haveningham, Suffolk, about 30 years of age, was
severely afflicted with scrofulous disease of the left side of the
face; the eye was completely closed&mdash;the jaw set fast&mdash;and the whole
side of the face much discoloured. She had been suffering a length of
time in great pain and misery, not being able to take sufficient food
scarcely to support nature; and from this cause, and the ravages of
the disease, her constitution had suffered material injury. All the
usual means were tried without avail, and J. Kent was requested, by a
highly respectable clergyman in the neighbourhood, to visit her. He
did so; and found her in the condition above described. J. K.
immediately commenced his peculiar mode of treatment, and in a very
short time the sight of the eye was restored, the jaw-bone became
released, and the face perfectly sound and well.&mdash;J. Kent understands
she is since married, and living near Norwich; but her friends are
still residing at Haveningham, and will satisfactorily answer any
inquirer.</p>

<p>SARAH WILLIAMS, daughter-in-law of Mr. Abraham Harvey, bricklayer,
Long Brackland, Bury St. Edmund's, aged about nine years, had been
afflicted for upwards of five years with a violent scorbutic humour on
the head and behind the ears; and both the eyes were so much affected
with scrofulous inflammation, that she could not bear the light upon
them, and the discharge and irritation rendered her situation quite
miserable. After the best advice had been procured in vain, she was
perfectly cured by J. Kent in a very short period of time; and,
although two years have elapsed, she has had no return of the
complaint. Her friends will furnish any further information which may
be required, with great pleasure.</p>

<h5><a name="case8" id="case8"></a>8.</h5>

<p>JOHN GOODING, Gent., Brook Street, Ipswich, now about 70 years of age,
had a severe attack of scrofula on the right thigh; he was brought
over from Ipswich to Stanton, when J. Kent found the thigh swollen to
an enormous size, attended with considerable inflammation, and with a
large quantity of matter formed between the muscles and integuments.
The pain was excruciating, and his health had declined extremely; and
it was with the greatest difficulty that he was moved about. He had
had the very best medical attention, without producing any good
effect; but by taking the medicines, and using the applications
prepared by J. Kent, and paying strict attention to the injunctions
laid down by him, suppuration soon took place, and the discharge was
excessive. The health soon began to improve, the parts affected
assumed a favourable aspect, and in three months he was perfectly
well; and although 20 years have passed over, Mr. G. has had no return
of the disease. Mr. G. is still residing as above, and always
communicative on the happy termination of his case.</p>

<h5><a name="case9" id="case9"></a>9.</h5>

<p>PHILIP MORLEY, of Mildenhall, Suffolk, about 17 years of age, applied
to J. Kent, at the Half Moon Inn, Bury, in consequence of scrofulous
disease of the back. It was hereditary, and he complained of much
weakness in the back, and had a very languid appearance. On examining
the back, there was an ulcer situated on the spine, just below the
shoulder, which discharged a thin whitish ichor. It had been about 12
months' standing, and had rendered him nearly incapable of following
his business as a tailor; and it appeared to be fast bringing him to
the grave. However, by a steady attention to the means prescribed by
J. Kent, he soon found himself better, and a perfect cure was the
result. He is now living in London; several of his connexions are very
respectable, and reference may be had by applying to J. Kent.</p>

<h5><a name="case10" id="case10"></a>10.</h5>

<p>THOMAS HUNT, aged 18 years, was placed under the care of J. Kent by
the churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Norton, Suffolk. He
had been for 12 months labouring under an attack of scrofula; there
were two scrofulous ulcers on the right side the neck, and a large
tumour under the chin. By attending strictly to the plan ordered by J.
Kent, a change soon took place for the better, and in a short time the
lad was perfectly well. Three years have elapsed, and he has had no
return of the disease, continuing well, and in service. Any further
inquiries may be made of the parish-officers or of the patient.</p>

<h5><a name="case11" id="case11"></a>11.</h5>

<p>In 1811, Mr. GEORGE ROSBROOK, Saddler, of Barrow, near Bury, Suffolk,
was attacked with a scrofulous complaint in his left thumb, from
whence it removed to his left hip and thigh; from thence to the left
knee, and then into his face and the glands of his throat; from whence
issued a clear water, insomuch that he was under the necessity of
keeping a piece of sponge constantly applied to it, especially at meal
times. In this disagreeable situation, he continued for more than two
years, during which time he had taken the best medical advice the
country and London could afford, without experiencing any material
benefit; and, in April, 1814, he applied to J. Kent. Not many weeks
had elapsed, before he perceived such an alteration, as induced him to
persevere in the use of the Botanical Medicines and Applications till
the following September, when he was perfectly cured. And although
<i>nineteen</i> years have intervened, no relapse has taken place.</p>

<h5><a name="case12" id="case12"></a>12.</h5>

<p>In 1811, RICHARD WHITBY, of Ipswich applied to J. Kent, afflicted with
scrofula in the right side of the face, attended with great swelling,
and the jaw-bone was entirely set fast. The pain he endured deprived
him of rest, and rendered him incapable of work. At length a place
broke in the inside of the mouth, and discharged very offensive
matter, and several tumours also gathered under the jaw, and on the
same side of the neck, and terminated in wounds. However, by the use
of the Botanical Medicines, he soon obtained relief, and in a short
time was perfectly well, and continues so to the present time (1833.)

<p>In 1826, Mr. WILLIAM RUFFELL, farmer, Cockfield, Suffolk, about 21
years of age, applied to J. Kent, grievously afflicted with an
extensive scrofulous wound, in the right arm-pit. The effect of the
Botanical Medicines may be learned from a perusal of the following
extract of a letter, which Mr. R. publicly addressed to J. K. in
1817:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I now enjoy a good state of health, and the perfect use of all my
limbs, which I attribute, under Providence, to your superior skill and
judgment. And surely I have great reason to do so, for it was not till
after I had tried every means in my power, and expended large sums of
money to no good purpose; it was not till my life was despaired of,
that I applied to you. I soon experienced the good effects of your
advice, and the wonderful efficacy of your incomparable Medicines, and
I think myself in duty bound, for the good of the country at large,
and in justice to your well-merited reputation, to give this public
testimony</i>."</p>

<p>In 1820, JOHN FAIERS, of Badwell Ash, Suffolk, aged about 45, was
placed under the care of J. Kent, by the parishioners of that parish,
afflicted with a violent scorbutic humour on the upper lip and face;
several tumours were also formed on and about the glands of the neck.
The case had been some time standing, and had hitherto resisted the
usual remedies; however, by a steady perseverance in the use of the
Botanical Medicines and Applications, the tumour dispersed, and the
virulence of the scorbutic humour was completely subdued; he speedily
recovered, and continues well to the present time.</p>

<h5><a name="case15" id="case15"></a>15.</h5>

<p>JOHN HAWES, of Badwell Ash, Suffolk, was placed under the care of J.
Kent, by the Parishioners of that Parish, in 1812, when he was
afflicted with Scrofula in his thigh, the left foot, the arm, and
other arts of his body, and his constitution was much impaired by the
severity and long continuance of the disease. In a short time his
health improved, by the use of the Botanical Medicines&mdash;by a steady
perseverance he ultimately recovered, and since that period, he has
been capable of laborious employment. During the cure, 23 pieces of
bone were extracted from the ulcerated parts, viz. three from the
thigh, five from the arm, and fifteen from the foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The great benefit which I have
received from your invaluable Medicines and Applications, induces me to
lay my own case before the public. In October, 1826, I applied to you,
in consequence of being afflicted with a scrofulous disease of the
left side of the glands of the neck. I am about 30 years of age, and
for a considerable time I suffered severely with the above complaint.
There was an ulcer on the left side of the neck&mdash;the glands were
much enlarged&mdash;and there was much discharge into the mouth from
an ulcer on the jaw. Every means which regular aid could suggest were
tried in vain, and the part was opened, but as no visible improvement
took place, and finding my health began to decline very rapidly, I
resolved to try the effect of your Medicines. In a very short time I
got better, my health improved, and by proper perseverance in the use
of the Medicines, the ulcers in my neck healed, the swelling
dispersed, and I got perfectly well, and I am glad to say that I
continue so to the present time. I shall be happy to furnish further
particulars of this case to any enquirer.</p>

applied to J. Kent, having been for 4 years afflicted with a
scrofulous Ulcer on the right side of the face. He had been in the
Dispensary at Ipswich, and every medical means had been employed for
four years without producing any good effect, and from the long

<p>JEMIMA BLAKE, of Wetherden, Suffolk, about 18 years of age, had been
for three years afflicted with scrofulous disease of the left ankle;
there was a large ulcer, and the whole foot and ankle much enlarged,
and attended with so much pain that she was quite a cripple; and her
constitution had become exceedingly debilitated. She had had suitable
attention, but she derived no benefit; she then applied to J. Kent,
and by attending to his instructions, her health was re-established,
and the ulcer is now quite healed, and she can walk extremely well,

<p>ADAM WRIGHT, of Wickhambrook, Suffolk, about 22 years of age, had been
afflicted with a scrofulous ulcer on the right side of the mouth for a
considerable time; it was so bad as to render it exceedingly difficult
for him to eat any food, except such as he took with a tea-spoon; in
this state he applied to J. Kent, and very soon received considerable
benefit; and in a letter to J. Kent, dated May 1833, he says, "I
received a perfect cure, and for the space of eleven years have
continued well."</p>

<h5><a name="case26" id="case26"></a>26.</h5>

<p>Some time since, GEORGE GOODCHILD, of Straddishall, near Newmarket,
was placed under the care of J. Kent, by the officers of that parish,
in consequence of being afflicted with Scrofula, or King's Evil. He
was about thirteen years of age, and the disease had been three years
standing, and the usual means for his recovery had been resorted to in
vain. There were two or three scrofulous ulcers on his left leg, which
was much enlarged; the bone was considerably diseased; his
constitution began to give way from the long continuance of the
disease, and he was incapable of labour. In this state he commenced
the treatment ordered by J. Kent; in a short time his constitution
became corrected and established, the leg improved, and a piece of
exfoliated bone was extracted, five inches and a half in length and an
inch in breadth, and he is now capable of following laborious
employment. In this case it is seen how prone Scrofula is to attack
the bones, which in many instances it completely destroys; here a
large piece of bone was removed before the parts got well, but this
bone was not removed simply "by the power of the Medicines alone," as
some persons would impudently and ignorantly assert, but nature, a
little mechanical assistance, and the <i>aid</i> of suitable Medicines and
Applications, all contributed to remove this extensive exfoliation of
the tibia, or large bone of the leg.</p>

<h5><a name="case27" id="case27"></a>27.</h5>

<p>JACOB GORRARD, of Troston, in this county, had been suffering from
Scrofula for nearly two years; the right arm and left knee were very
much enlarged; there were three or four extensive wounds, and the knee
was very much contracted. He had been attended by two surgeons and a
physician, but the disease set their combined efforts at defiance, and
when J. Kent was requested to attend, the patient had been confined to
his bed for nine months, his appetite was destroyed, there were
profuse nocturnal perspirations, a hectic flush upon the countenance,
the arm, leg, and thigh, enlarged to a frightful degree, and the
wounds poured forth a copious discharge; in fact, there appeared so
little chance of doing any good, that it was with considerable
reluctance that J. Kent undertook the case. J. K. however, commenced
his peculiar mode of treatment in September, 1824, and the result was,
that a perfect cure was effected, and Gorrard is still living at
Troston, enjoying an excellent state of health, the perfect use of all
his limbs, and capable of any laborious exertion. This remarkable case
merits the attention of all those who, unfortunately, are subjects of
Scrofula. It affords a distinct proof that this unsightly and
dangerous disease may be controlled and arrested in its progress by
the use of those means so long pursued by J. Kent with unequalled
success; means which are so simple in their nature that our fields,
our hedges, and our way-sides, contribute to their composition without
resorting to metallic formulations.</p>

<h5><a name="case28" id="case28"></a>28.</h5>

<p>In 1807, JOHN PAKE, of Rickinghall, Suffolk, was placed under the care
of J. Kent, by the parishioners of that parish, having been, for
nearly all his life, subject to Scrofula. In June of that year, it
violently attacked his left knee, which was excessively painful,
swelled very much, and soon became so contracted, as to render it
useless to him. He had procured all the assistance which regular
practice could afford, but all proved ineffectual, and he was
pronounced incurable, unless amputation took place. In November
following, he began the treatment directed by J. Kent, and very soon
found relief, and by August, 1808, he was so well as to engage himself
for harvest work. <i>Twenty-five</i> years have elapsed, and he still
continues perfectly well, and is still residing at Rickinghall.</p>

<p>Mrs. MARY HOWLETT, wife of Mr. Thomas Howlett, farmer, of Soham,
Cambridgeshire, had been from an early period of her life, afflicted
with Scrofula; and, in 1807, the disorder violently attacked her back,
just below the blade-bone, and produced a tumour that exceeded
twenty-two inches in circumference. She was totally incapable of any
employment, the pain was excessive, and the case truly alarming.
Having had the best advice that could be procured for her, without
producing any good effect, she committed herself wholly to the care of
J. Kent, under whose treatment the tumour soon suppurated, and
discharged upwards of <i>three quarts</i> of matter the first time, and not
less than <i>two gallons</i> before the cure was completed. Since then,
more than <i>twenty-four</i> years have elapsed, and she continues
perfectly sound and well.</p>

<p>A professional inhabitant of Bury had suffered severely from a
scorbutic eruption, affecting nearly the whole body; after trying a
great number of remedies for a considerable time without deriving any
benefit, he applied to J. Kent; by attending to whose instructions, he
was perfectly cured. Reference may be had on a personal application to
J. Kent.</p>

<p>About twelve months ago, Mr. ADAMS, (Park-keeper to his Grace the Duke
of Grafton) of Euston, Suffolk, placed his daughter under the care of
J. Kent, in consequence of her having been for some time afflicted
with a scrofulous enlargement of the left knee; indeed, the knee was
so much diseased and contracted that she could not walk without the
assistance of crutches. Her friends closely attended to the directions
of J. Kent, who a few days since saw her father, when he said that his
daughter had thrown away her crutches, and was running about in good
health.</p>

<p>In March, 1826, MARY ANN BAKER, of Rattlesden, Suffolk, about 11 years
of age, was brought to J. Kent by the order of the Churchwardens and
Overseers of that parish. She was hereditarily predisposed to
Scrofula, and at this period had a tumour about the size of a hen's
egg on each breast; she had also <i>twenty</i> ulcers on the breast and
neck, besides <i>twelve</i> ulcers on the right arm: she had been in this
state upwards of two years; but by a steady perseverance in the use of
the medicines, and under the directions of J. Kent, she received a
perfect cure.</p>

<p><i>I saw her September 14, 1833, when I found she continued perfectly
well; in good health and spirits</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Kent</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#case14">In case 14</a>, page 24, of this pamphlet, the case of
JOHN FAIERS of Great Ashfield, Suffolk, is described; and it is again
adverted to in order to shew the hereditary nature of Scrofula, which
is remarkably developed in several members of his family; no less than
four of his children having been attacked with the disease: 1. His son
<i>John</i> suffered from it in the groin and on the thigh; 2. His daughter
<i>Sophia</i> about the neck and windpipe; 3. <i>Sarah</i> was also afflicted
with it; 4. <i>Mary</i> had several Scrofulous ulcers on the leg; these
were all patients of J. Kent, and received a perfect cure from the
treatment adopted by him.</p>

<p>WILLIAM NUNN, of Lawshall, near Bury St. Edmund's, about eighteen
years of age, applied to J. Kent, in May, 1832, in consequence of
having a Scrofulous enlargement on the left side the lower jaw: the
part affected had assumed an alarming appearance; but by steadily
attending to the directions ordered, a perfect cure was the result;
and his father informed J. Kent about three weeks since that he
continued quite well.</p>

<p>A young lady belonging to one of the most respectable families in the
vicinity of Stanton, had suffered for some time from scrofulous
disease of the left hand; and as her parents were in affluent
circumstances, no expense was spared in procuring the best surgical
advice in the kingdom; this, however, was to no effect, and she was
placed under the care of J. Kent, under whose treatment twenty-five
pieces of bone were extracted from the diseased part; and although her
health had become much impaired, she speedily improved, and ultimately
a perfect cure took place. Seventeen years have now elapsed, and she
has not had the least symptom of a relapse.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Any respectable person may have reference to the family, on a
personal application to J. Kent.</p>

<h5><a name="case36" id="case36"></a>36.</h5>

<p>JOHN STEBBINGS, Gardener, Rickinghall, Suffolk, in February 1830, took
his son James, about 4 years of age, to J. Kent. The child had two
scrofulous tumours on the left fore-arm; a large one on the right
thigh; and one on the calf of the right leg: the disease had been
about 9 months standing, and his health was much impaired. He had not
been under the care of J. K. but a short time before his health was
materially improved; and the tumours suppurated, healed, and got
completely well. He is now in good health and has had no return of the
disease.</p>

<p>After the reader has candidly and attentively perused the above cases,
I trust it will not appear to be necessary for me to extend the number
any farther, although it would be perfectly easy to do so. I presume
enough has been stated to show the superiority of my mode of
treatment; and if there be any who can rise from the perusal of these
cases, and doubt that superiority, they "would not be persuaded though
one rose from the dead."</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would beg to state that many who have experienced the
good effects of my treatment of scrofulous diseases, frequently have
recourse to some of the medicine every spring and autumn, as an
alterative and a preventive. This prudent, cautious conduct, I would
strongly recommend to all parents, guardians, and heads of families,
who have any reason to apprehend the disorders of their children, or
those under their care, to arise from a scrofulous predisposition; and
by such timely care they may prevent those dreadful consequences which
too frequently arise from neglect or improper treatment.</p>

<h5><b>KENT'S</b></h5>

<h5><i>VEGETABLE ANTI-BILIOUS PILLS</i></h5>


<p><span class="small">Have now been before the public a period of fourteen years, after ten
years' experience in private practice, of their salutary effect in a
variety of instances; and their increasing demand unquestionably
proves their superior efficacy in rousing the action of the liver, and
cleansing the stomach of slime and acid matter. The proprietors offer
them in full confidence that they will generally answer the purpose
for which they are intended, and be found an excellent remedy in all
obstructions of the bowels and disorders of the stomach, arising
either from a redundancy of bile, or a deficiency of that important
secretion; from flatulency, indigestion, or cold. In the sick
head-ache, the speedy relief they give is wonderful; and they are
particularly calculated to strengthen the digestive organs. They
promote the powers of digestion, create appetite, disperse flatulence
in the stomach and bowels, and in a little time remove all the painful
effects of crudities, indigestion, and habitual costiveness. They are
gentle, but safe and certain in their operation, offering no
impediment to business, and are not liable to leave any disposition to
costiveness. The proprietors pledge themselves that the pills do not
contain a single particle of mercury, antimony, or any other mineral,
but that their composition is <i>purely vegetable</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">The pills are prepared only, and sold by the sole
Inventors and Proprietors, at their own house in Stanton, in Suffolk, in
boxes 1s. 1d., each, duty included; and by the following authorised agents.
Thompson, Bookseller, Bury; Robinson, Bookseller, Ditto; Gall and
Nunn, Chemists, Ditto; Fitch, Chemist, Ipswich; Cupiss, Chemist, Diss;
Chapman, Chemist, Thetford; Breeze, Chemist, Ditto; Woolby,
Bookseller, Stowmarket, and by most respectable Medicine Vendors.</span></p>
